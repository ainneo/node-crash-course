### View Engines

- a template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
- some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS
- in this tut we are using EJS - see EJS Docs for more info
